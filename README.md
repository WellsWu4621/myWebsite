# myWebsite
My personal Website version
This website is simple and contains 3 main pages.

The main page, is the About Me page approached with a simple two column grid with a navbar and footer

The Portfolio page consists of 4 projects that I have clearly made. There is absolutely no lie there. It has 4 cells with a card in each cell. The links all lead to the "deployed version" of the site.

Contacts page is only a card with a method to add name, email, and message. Unfortunately the submit button will not actually submit the message anywhere, though it does link to somewhere?

The footer has links to social media links, the other pages, and a copyright xD.
